# Rust Pyspec DB

This is a Rust implementation of the State DB format used by the python based
[Ethereum Execution Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs).

It is ***Extremely Alpha*** and only contains the minimum functionality to get
the Rust Pyspec Snapshot tool to work. It currently doesn't have e.g.
`get_storage()`.
